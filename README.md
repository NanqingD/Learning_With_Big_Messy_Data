This is our project for ORIE 4741.
The name of our project is: Movie quality prediction.
The names and Cornell IDs of the project members are: Ziyi Chen (zc286), Yuan Cheng (yc956), Nanqing Dong (nd367)
A one or two paragraph description of our project is: 
  We will use a dataset of 5000+ movies from Kaggle to select important predictors of good movies and predict the qualities of movies based on their features. Then if time allows, we will predict the trend of favorite topics, and help movie makers to find appropriate directors and actors for some certain types of movies.
