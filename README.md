# Learning_With_Big_Messy_Data

  This is our project for ORIE 4741.  
  
  The names and Cornell IDs of the project members are: Ziyi Chen (zc286), Yuan Cheng (yc956), Nanqing Dong (nd367)
  
  The name of our first potential project is: Movie quality prediction. The description of our first project proposal is: 
    We will use a dataset of 5000+ movies from Kaggle to select important predictors of good movies and predict the qualities of movies based on their features. Then if time allows, we will predict the trend of favorite topics, and help movie makers to find appropriate directors and actors for some certain types of movies.
    
  The name of our second potential project is: seismic structure response prediction. The description of our second project proposal is:
    We will use 1000 simulated ground motions time series dataset to predict response displacements of structure systems. In this project, we propose to find the relationship between inputs time series and the corresponding response by using machine learning methods such as linear regression, nonparametric regression, support vector machine (SVM), and neuro network.
